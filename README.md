## Process of this project
This project is based on a user's prespective from signing in on their account to selecting a book and then placing order. Method was used here for automating the website. By calling the methods all the actions was performed. The process for the automation: 

Firstly, the user will sign in on https://www.rokomari.com/book. Then they would select an author of their choice and select a book for purchasing.

Secondly, for selecting the book some filtering has been done and then the selected book would go to the cart for shipping information.

Lastly, all of the shipping information was placed by automation.
